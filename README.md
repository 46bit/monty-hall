# What is it?

A basic ruby / rspec project setup and ready to go.

# Instructions

Write a programme that simulates ‘rock paper scissors’ 

## Rules:
Each player chooses one of Rock, Paper, Scissors. When both have selected the following rules are applied to determine the winner:

* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beats Paper
* Paper beats Rock
* Same move is a draw

Start by implementing the logic. If you get chance you can extend the programme by making it interactive and adding a UI


# Use it

Bundle.

Run `bin/rspec` - you should get "No examples found".
